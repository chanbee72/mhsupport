t3_2uoha1,t1_cob9c2k,"My fingertips are hard/pale and they're both numb and painful at the same time. It feels like my fingers are wrapped in hard smooth rubber. I pick at the scar tissue because it feels better to have raw normal feeling skin (underneath) but it's a vicious cycle because the scar tissue grows back. Whenever I try to stop the scar tissue gets brittle and splits open anyway. Sometimes I don't know if picking it off is good or bad.

t3_3re914,t1_cwne6al,"I have trouble waking up most mornings, its like i have to drag myself, because thats what im supposed to do. I have friends, and a supportive family, even a girlfriend. So why do i always feel so lonely? Ive done so much to try and make myself happy, i finished nursing school, got my dream job right out of school working in a cardiac ICU. I still feel empty, and unhappy with who i am. I fight this everyday, and the feeling of loneliness makes this fight feel unfair. Why cant i just pull through this? Some days are better than others, but it seems like lately though the bad days are overshadowing the good. Ive never wanted to end it, but i do wish i could just lock myself in this room, and everyone could just forget about me. I feel pathetic writing this, but id feel even worse keeping this to myself. Ive tried talking to people about the way i feel, but its like no one understands.

t3_3em9r1,t1_ctgk0et,"**(WARNING: WALL OF TEXT)****(SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DR VERSION)**When my dad died early last year, I threw myself into my work almost immediately after the funeral was over, once everyone started going back home and moving on.  I became distant from my wife and young daughter and refused to allow anyone to comfort me.  I was already depressed before his death because, while I loved the people I worked with, I hated my job.  A few months after my dad??? death, a lot of changes started happening at work to make matters even more difficult.  In the span of four months, a new director had taken over, several coworkers either left or were let go, and many new policies/reforms were being made.  Take my refusal to grieve the loss of my father and the stress of hating my job already and I quickly spiraled.I was constantly at work or bringing my work home with me.  I isolated myself from my friends and family.  When I wasn't working, I threw myself into food, television, and video games to avoid everyone and everything and I gained about 40 pounds in the last year.  However, in spite of working many hours (60-70 hours a week) already, my job felt like it was becoming more about the case files, evaluations, staff meetings, and billing, and less about actually helping the clients we were supposed to serve.  Pretty soon, I just couldn't keep up with it anymore.  I fell so far behind that it took me nearly a full month to catch back up again.  I didn't tell anyone at work how far behind I truly was until I'd been caught and it took far longer to catch up than they were happy with and so it was time for me to go.The first thing I felt was relief.  As I said before, I loved my coworkers and helping my clients, but there was no doubt I hated my job.  I couldn't stand to be there anymore. I knew that being let go was the most likely course of action and I welcomed it.  I just surprised myself with how much I welcomed it, in spite of the emotional and financial struggle I knew it would bring to me and my family.The next thing I felt was that long awaited grief.  I felt anger and sadness toward myself for allowing myself hide for so long, for not letting my family be there to comfort me when they tried to, for using work as an excuse to avoid the issues, for letting down everyone I cared about, for not grieving the loss of my father, for everything.About a month before being let go, I had finally begun opening up to my wife and made her aware of everything that was going on.  The day I was let go began a long set of talks that lasted, off and on, for the better part of a week.  We had a great deal to catch up on and so we talked??_  We talked about everything we avoided talking about over the past year: all the pain we felt, all the feelings we'd been keeping hidden from one another, the stress we've been under, the stress I'd caused her and our daughter, the fact that I nearly drove them both away, all of it.  When my wife was at work and our daughter in daycare, I was out applying for jobs everywhere.  I applied for any place I could find from retail to custodial work, no job was beneath me.  We both took odd jobs under the table here and there for cash to keep us afloat.  When my wife wasn't at work, we were continuing our conversations from wherever we'd left off that morning/the night before.  We talked, we laughed, we cried??_  It was the first time I had let myself experience **genuine** emotions in over a year.  It was the first time I did not feel the need to hide myself anymore or fear being vulnerable anymore.  There were no more ???brave faces???or repressed feelings anymore.  There was no more hiding from my family.I have spent every waking moment since losing my job devoting my free time to emotionally reconnecting with my family and my friends again.  For the first time in a year, I am genuinely crying again.  I am genuinely laughing again.  I am genuinely smiling again.  Our daughter is constantly cracking us up, my wife and I have never been more close or affectionate than we are now, my friends and I are talking again.  Everyone I love have all noticed the change and have been amazingly supportive.  And damn if it doesn??? feel amazing??_  Now, it??? up to me to make sure I don??? let myself withdraw from life again.Toward the goal of getting back on our feet and gaining both financial and emotional stability again, I just took my teaching certification exam this morning and I passed!!!  My wife and my family have been extremely supportive throughout this entire endeavor and, for the first time in years, I feel hope for the future again.  I truly would be lost without them and I am glad that I finally realized it.**TL;DR -** After isolating myself to avoid grieving my father??? death and depression from hating my job, losing said job, and nearly losing my family, I??? bouncing back, I have my family back, and I'm loving life again! AND I??? GOING TO BE A TEACHER!",I'm so sorry you went through this but it is heart warming to read a happy ending.  So glad you managed to turn things around and good luck for the future.,"death, a lot of changes started happening at work to make matters even more difficult.  ",2,0,0
t3_3q7kn1,t1_cz6ggz1,"Let me tell you all my story. I've seen two therapist over this and it seems like I can never feel any comfort. This is something that less than a handful of people know about. When I was young (around ~8 years old) my parents got divorced. My father remarried and had children, my mother started dating someone. This someone is my ""stepfather"" although they are legally not married. He seemed like a nice guy at first. He would help me with research projects, help my mom out with rent and he would buy my brother and I clothes when my mom could not. Everything changed when he moved into the house when I was about 12. At that time I was in middle school and I was going through an awkward phase where I was learning about myself. I was figuring out what type of people I like to hang out with or what not. I was online a lot and I went on a lot of chat rooms (I know, very bad and very dangerous at that time). Just to clarify, I did not receive any education on the dangers in chat rooms from anyone. Well the point is that my step father would check out what was on my computer a lot without my knowledge. I became very close to him, mainly because my dad was no longer close to me. I used to sit on his lap like I did with my dad and I use to play around with him like I did with my dad because at the time this is how I viewed him. Unfortunately these are things that I regret so much now that I am older. He then started to try and kiss me on my mouth and he would even try to put his tongue in my mouth. I blew it off because I thought it was a mistake or maybe he didn't mean it. At this time I was like 12-13. This would happen a lot and I would notice that it happened when my mom was not around. At 14 I entered high school and I started to become a bit rebellious. I wanted more freedom, I wanted to hang out with friends after school and I wanted money to hang out with. My stepfather is a business man and at the time he was working with a company in which he was making a lot of money so when I needed money for ice cream at the mall or shopping with friends. Well since my mom didn't have this money, he would take advantage of this and he would give me the money with ""conditions"" . These conditions started alongside with threats. He knew I loved going online and talking to strangers (I know terrible idea) and he also know I would talk to my friends a lot via AIM, MySpace and Facebook (when it picked up popularity around my sophomore/Junior year of HS). He would go through my computer and threaten me by saying things like ""Im going to tell your mom what you talk about with your friend"" or ""Im going to tell your mom that you came home late"". Usually it was about telling my mom about something he only knew. He began to make me take my pants off to spank me with his bare hands (~15,16) on my bare butt. He would rub my cheeks and sometimes try to open them and he would spank me. I agreed to it because I didn't want my mom finding out and punishing me for things, she was very strict at the time. Then he began to do this when I needed money for anything. If I needed 20$ he would need to spank me 20 times. The larger the item i needed, the more spanks. He would also try to fondle me and would still try to kiss me on a daily basis. The issue with me is that I am a VERYY forgiving person. In my head I would think "" okay maybe he won't do it again, or maybe it was a mistake"" but clearly there were no mistakes being made. He consciously knew what he was doing and he knew his intentions.Well in school I began dating boys and when this happened, the abuse became worse and worse. He began exposing himself to me and would try to kiss me really hard. One time I threatened to tell my mom because I knew that what was going on was wrong. He threatened to leave which to a normal person sounded great but to me I did not. My mom didn't make a lot of money and before he came into our lives, my mom and I along with my younger brother shared a cramped 1 bedroom apartment. My father was offering very little financial support even though he was supposed to based on his child support agreement with my mom. I barely got to see my mom because she was working day and night to put food on the table. When my mom met him she was extremely happy and she was happier than I had ever seen her. She was home a lot more often. I felt that by telling her what was going on, I would make her unhappy (she was blinded by love) and I would destroy the family. I decided to keep things to myself and the abuse continued. When I was 17 the abuse was getting out of hand and I had never told a soul at this point and one day I blurted it out to my best friend on our way to the train. I cried so hard because it was the first time I had ever heard myself talk about the abuse out loud. It was the first time I heard what I had gone through (if that makes much sense). Her first reaction was to tell our school counselor, but I was afraid again for destabilizing our home life. I felt that I needed to suck up the abuse. At the time I was planning on going away for college. I thought to myself that college was going to be my escape. well later, I had a close friend who was having a sweet 16 in a diff. state. I had family in that state and thats how I met her. This girl's family was basically family as well considering that my grandmother raised her mom and was best friends with her grandmother. At this point after the conversation with my friend, I began to deny my step father spankings and I would stop going into his room to speak to him. He did not like this, so he became a lot more harsh. If I wanted to hang out after school or anything I would ask my mom who would then ask him. He would say no every single time. Every now and then I would go to his room but I felt disgusting. It started to take a huge toll on me emotionally. Finally my friend's sweet 16 was approaching and my mom could not go, so the idea was to send me to stay the weekend at my grandmother's house and go with my aunt and grandmother. He said no, of course. I was so fucking pissed. I could literally feel my blood boiling out of anger because I knew the 1 reason he was no for. I blurted it out to my mom. I told her ""HE DOESNT WANT TO LET ME GO BECAUSE I WONT LET HIM TOUCH ME ANYMORE"". She just starred at me blankly and she began to scream and cry shortly after. She begged me to tell her everything, but I was so embarrassed and disgusted with myself that I could only bring myself to give her minimal details. She was crying and she called a friend of hers telling her everything and asking for advice. She called him and she told him that he needed to get home immediately because she needed to speak to him. I was both happy and sad. Happy because the abuse would stop but sad because this meant that we would have to struggle again. Well this all turned into pure sadness and anger. she began telling me that I must've misunderstood him. She was like maybe he was drunk (he's an alcoholic btw) and things got out of hand. She said to me ""see thats why I told you not to sit on his lap"" I felt terrible because she was looking for excuses to justify him. What hurt me the most was when she said ""I don't want to go to the police because it would then ruin his life and I don't want to do that."" The minute she said that, I decided that I was never going to tell her again. When he got home, of course he denied everything no surprise there. Things went back to normal and things were actually okay for a while. He wasn't being a perv anymore. I thought that maybe the thought of him being outed scared him to the point where he wouldn't bother me again. MANN I was so wrong. We moved from an apartment in a pretty shitty area of NYC to a gorgeous and spacious house in NYC. At this time I was getting ready to leave for college, but unfortunately I could not pull a loan to go away for school. My mom's credit was butchered and no one in my family had high enough credit/income to help me with a 30,000 loan and of course why would my step dad help me move away when all he wanted to do was torture me. I was forced to stay home. My one escape was ruined. I was able to go to a state school near home which had accepted me before but I denied. At this time my step father confessed his love for me and he told me that he did not love my mom as much as he loved me. I had planned to run away that night. I had no money, no where to go, no house or family I could stay with. That was the night I also decided that I was not going to let him touch me anymore, EVER. At this point I was about 18 and he began to get creative in  his methods. Now he would masterbate near my bedroom door so I could hear him. When I would leave the house he would follow me and stay on top of the staircase. If I looked back or if I left something and I turned back I would find him there masterbating. Taking a shower was an impossible task because he would stand by my door and masterbate or he would creep open the door and peak in on me showering. The doors did not have a functional lock. One day I got so pissed I kicked the door closed and thats how I confirmed he was there since I received resistance from a flimsy door. The doorknob was non-function at the time (the house was very old and absolutely nothing had been updated since like 1960) and he removed it. It took him over 6 months to replace a fucking doorknob because he used it to peep in on me showering. I started coming up with elaborate ways to help combat him. I started jamming the door closed with a towel so that when the door would open, I could actually hear it. I could barely sleep because I was afraid he would creep into my bedroom (btw I don't know if he ever did this) I began to see a therapist on campus because I started to feel suicidal and I started to lose interest in school. She wanted to report but again I refused because I felt guilty. There are moments where things do get better and months go by where he doesn't do these things, but they usually start up again. One time I asked my mom to pick me up from work since I had a very late shift. She sent him and he arrived with his dick out masterbating as I was in the car. He did this a couple of time and one time my mom said oh I'm sending him over and i said oh nvm 'so and so' is taking me home. I started asking coworkers for rides home during late night shifts to avoid him. We moved into a new place and the abuse seemed to subside because the new house was significantly smaller and it was harder for him to hide while doing what he was doing. But again I was wrong. He began peeping in on me in the shower again. this new door had a function lock which he was screw with in order to open it. I learned how he opened it and I started to open the linen closet door (it is right next to the bathroom door so when it is open it blocks the bathroom door). That helped a lot. If I am in the house alone with him, he'll stay in his room, turn off the light and stick his dick out the door when its slightly open. I have no idea if he thinks this is to ""entice"" me of whatever. I have the temptation to kick the door when he does that. I also think he still masterbates by the door in his room because when I approach the bathroom which is literally a foot away from his bedroom door, I will see his door slowly shut. I was actually inspired to write out my story today because as I was heading to the kitchen to grab something to drink, he was just sitting there masterbating and looking at me. I spoke to another therapist about this. He says that this is his way of exerting his dominance because he knows that my mom won't really leave because she needs his financial support. She is also btw head over heals like a 16 year old in love with him. Now I am 22 and Im living with this pervert and I am DYING to move. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I are both college students and we're very broke. I also am planning to go to medical school and we all know how expensive and demanding it is. I feel like I am stuck where I am and Im starting to feel very restless and anxious now. Well thats my story. It actually feels amazing to get all of this off my chest. I feel like I just spilled 10 years worth of secrets. I would actually like to see comments/questions so please feel free to do so!","Please, please, please get out of that house. Nothing is worth living like this, absolutely nothing. You may think you need to live there because he is supporting you but you don't. Go to the police ASAP.

t3_2cwkov,t1_cjjq5o9,"I am on a train, and the next stop is failing.  In 2 weeks I will have my final exams of my business school degree and I know that I will fail them.  The subject is something which I chose because it looked fun and interesting to me and is also extremely well paid, however half way through I began to realise that the mathematics and concepts involved were much harder than I could have imagined and my grades quickly began to fall. Having completed an undergraduate degree in physics I thought that this was something which I should be able to cope with but gradually as more topics were introduced I started failing coursework and exams and only was able to cope in any form by getting huge amounts of help from others on my course.I am now at the point where in 2 weeks I will have a series of exams which I have no way of getting a passing grade in, people tell me that it'll be alright and not as bad as I think it is, but it will be.

According to her she spent 30 minutes to an hour setting up and was about to knock the chair out from under her just moments before I messaged her. I woke up just in time and I fully believe she would've. I don't get why or how this happened but it was incredible how lucky she was.

t3_36s2fp,t1_crhtwfb,"Hello, I've never posted here just kind of lurked, but I'm having a pretty rough time right now and need some help/advice whatever. I've had an anxiety/panic/depression disorder since I was about 15, i went to therapy for a little while, took medication for a bit and for the most part things have been okay I suppose. Ive had bumps in the road here and there, lately I've been feeling good. I've got an awesome girlfriend, a job I enjoy, a supportive family. However this Monday I woke up in the morning from a disturbing dream, it wasn't really a nightmare or anything frightening in that sense, it was me standing on a porch kind of yelling  ""I feel dead inside, I feel dead inside"" as soon as I woke up, boom full blown anxiety attack. This has happened to me before, I'll have some strange dream that will trigger an anxiety attack, but its more like an anxiety episode that lasts weeks months maybe. I just can't do it anymore, I'm sick of feeling okay just to be shot down again. I can barely eat, I feel like I'm a 1000 miles away from everyone and anything that's going on,all my surroundings feel unfamiliar in a way, my mind feels so fogged and jumbled that even writing this is a challenge. I'm so obsessed with the idea that I have schizophrenia that I've taken every test on the internet, read every article about and somehow applied symptoms from it to my life. The most annoying thing is I've done this already, the last time this happened I did the same thing, took the tests read WebMD. Every therapist I've been to has said the same thing ""meccaandsoul, you don't have schizophrenia I want you to get that out of your mind"".... I can't though its all consuming, I'm just so tired of this, I don't wanna do it anymore. I obsess over everything I do, constantly questioning why I did something a certain way or why did I have that thought comparing it to some symptom I saw on the internet. I guess I'm just looking for some insight or maybe I just needed to rant.","The worst thing you can do with anxiety is to research symptoms online and do some crazy tests. You have a headache and you google a symptom next thing you have diagnosed yourself with a brain tumour.I understand how you feel, I thought I had 'beat' anxiety for a few months and then it all came flooding back. I was saying the same things as you, ""Im sick of this, I can't do this anymore"" etc etc.What I learned from this is, you just have to accept what is. Whatever you accept, you overcome - what you resist, you are stuck with forever. Just let it be, find the calm in life.

t3_3a6dr5,t1_cs9pn0p,"Last week my dad had said he had seen some stray kittens underneath our cars, warning me to be careful whenever I drove off. So the following Wednesday, though I was running late for an appointment, I did the ol' checkaroo and shooed at the three kittens I saw. Starting my car in park and checking all sides to make sure none crawled up my car's undercarriage, I noticed a tiny orangish kitten sitting next to my tire. He hadn't moved and on closer inspection I noticed his eyes were caked w/ greenish gunk, leaving him blind. I couldn't leave him, taking note that it was drizzling and saw no signs of the mama cat around, so I scooped him up with thoughts of temporarily taking care of him for the time being.After picking up some kitten milk replacement formula, I proceeded to bathe him and rid him of his eye gunk. Once he was all taken care of I set him in a shoebox lined with cloth to warm him. I told myself once the weather warmed up and I saw his kitten siblings/mom I'd let him loose. Well it rained the rest of that day, and the next day I saw no signs of his siblings or mama cat. At this point the little guy was starting to warm up to me, I even named him Fievel(from the American Tail movie where a mouse gets separated from his family), but I knew I couldn't take care of him being my household was already packed with two dogs and a cat. By Saturday I finally caught sight of his mama, and by Sunday, due to prodding from my mom and my bf and my own cat's perceived jealousy, with a heavy heart I released him once I saw his siblings once more. He looked so happy to frolick with them.Since then I made the effort to check all our cars just to get a glimpse that he was doing okay, worrying that I might've ruined his stray cat perceptiveness by keeping him too long. I saw his siblings time and time again with no sight of him anywhere. it wasn't until the following Monday after coming home from dinner with my bf I saw him sitting next to the tire of my mom's car towards the street with mama cat underneath. I was thrilled! The Tuesday after, before going to work, I saw him once more, this time underneath my car with his siblings. From then on I started feeling better about the release, that I had done my part in helping the little guy, and that perhaps once he got a couple weeks older I could finally take him for real and find him a loving home with one of my friends. Little did I know that would be the last time I'd see him.A couple hours ago I routinely let out my dogs to do their thing in the backyard/eat/drink, when I noticed my german shepherd showing lots of interest to the back of my shed. Taking a peek, I found my own cat(note: he is an indoor cat so it's unusual to find him outside) behind there. He started hissing and that's when I noticed one of the stray kittens behind him. After failing to get the two of them out, I decided to check our cars to see the other kittens' wellbeing and hopefully see Fievel all well and happy. Well I saw one underneath my car. Check. Then I noticed the other underneath our spare car. Not Fievel, but Check. I thought perhaps he's underneath the spare car too as I made my way over and crouched, but that's when I noticed the kitten looking out in front of the car. There lying sprawled out, his little body flattened, was Fievel. My heart sank and immediately ran inside. Since then I've been a sobbing mess, peeking out my window hoping what I saw wasn't real, yet seeing his body again and again. What's worse is when I realized that my mom's car parks in front of that spare car. I can't help but regret letting him go. I should've kept him. He would've been safer inside with me, but I regretted taking him from his family. Once my dad gets home, I'll have him buried in his box in my front yard. I'm sorry, Fievel.TL;DR: Took in stray kitten, grew attached, released it back to it's stray family despite conflicted feelings, kitten ends up getting ran over presumably by my mom","That is so sad!

t3_2h0tqp,t1_ckobn44,"I think I read somewhere that anxiety medication ideally is only for short-term use (maybe six months - a year or so), and should be used in conjunction with some sort of effective psychotherapy. It shouldn't be used long-term because you build up a tolerance, have to increase the dose, and eventually the side effects outweigh the benefits. Is that correct? I guess I'm asking because I've been having therapy for a few months and haven't noticed any reduction in my anxiety. I'm wondering if medication would actually help in my case, or if the potential reduction in anxiety would only be short-term and unsustainable given that the therapy doesn't seem to be working.","I am doing the same thing. I have a counselor at school that I meet every week to talk about things. He gave me the choice of having no medicine or taking medicine. I choose the former and at first thought that was enough. I improved a little, but I still can't talk in front of classes, in small groups, or focus on tasks without worrying about everything around me.  All that stacked on depression really tends to suck for school.I'm now considering taking lexipro and continuing with my CBT training. I can't wait :).Now for your question/inquiry!Before I went to a therapist I would take benedryll before social confrontations like a presentation or an outing. Ofcourse it would make me very sleepy but it would also slow my heart rate (vs the million beats a min it would do other wise). After awhile I hated taking the benedryll because I would get incredibly tired. So I stopped taking it and noticed that I can do this without the medicine.So medicine is a short term fix (I know it's not the exact situation you listed). With proper therapy and help it speeds up the process and allows for you to function much better without meds or assistance. It shows you that everything is fine, you don't need to worry about trivial things. Kinda like after you ride a bike, the first time is scary as shit, but after practice, that shit is easy. Medicine is always worth a try. You can get medicines that are non addictive (like lexipro) or you can get medicines that are for stressful situations (imberal). Either way only 6 months to a year is not going to hurt you. If the meds don't work for the long term then think as it as a vacation from the hell that is anxiety.",Ofcourse it would make me very sleepy but it would also slow my heart rate (vs the million beats a min it would do other wise).,0,2,2

It is the stupidest thing because we never officially dated, by the time my stupid ass self asked her out, she already had boyfriend.  My regret is not telling her how I felt way sooner, but I had some dumb moral code I had to follow.  We were great friends and we had talked a lot back then, and perhaps that is what I miss. But after she shoot me down because of already being in a relationship, I said I would never bother her again.

t3_3ml6j0,t1_cvgyqnj,"Kevin and I were perfect for each other. At least, that's what everyone who really knew us said. He was a nerd. A video game playing, Modest Mouse loving, introverted guy who was on the tail end of tackling his depression and finally graduating college after five and a half years. I was a nerd. A video game playing, My Chemical Romance loving, extroverted young woman who was fully convinced she was doomed to a life without romantic love and was struggling her way through freshman weed out classes at a large university. We met in group therapy. Now, you have to understand, our relationship was full of odd coincidences and strangely spot on foreshadowing, but this was the first of those incidences. My grief counselor now is the same therapist who led the group. Funny how things turn out. The second coincidence: the fact that, one day in therapy, we focused on another member who was anxious about a genetic test. Her mom had recently discovered that she carried a gene that's indicative of breast cancer, so her daughter ???our fellow group member ???obviously had to be tested for it. Kevin would later tell me that he sat in that dimly lit room, struggling to grasp how he would deal with her situation. He was so grateful at the time that oncogenes didn't run in his family. That was before he was tested for CDH1. That was before he knew he was positive for CDH1. That was before he had stomach cancer. We spent the next few months working through a tough situation (that I won't elaborate on) together and becoming best friends, him quickly falling for me while I was too busy caught up in someone else who would eventually leave me behind for a nomadic lifestyle. A little while after the other guy left, Kevin asked me on a date, leading to a night of loudly talking about Japanese blow job game shows at a fancy restaurant and playing Silent Hill 2. I couldn't think of a more perfect date. Still, I wasn't fully convinced that I was romantically interested in him, which he took with grace and backed off to a very respectable level. Nonetheless, I could tell he never fully gave up on the idea of us. Months passed by. We went to shitty concerts, spent far too long in each other's apartments, helped one another through hangovers, and had hours-long conversations that usually ended in the conclusion: ???Life is weird.???  He was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer a month after graduating. Even though the five year survival rate for his stage of stomach cancer is 4%, he convinced me that he was going to get his stomach removed after a few rounds of chemo, and life would continue as normal. I believed him. Only later did I realize that it was just his wonderfully developed sense of hope talking. The cancer was inoperable. Still, that same sense of hope kept him going long enough for me to pull my head far enough out of my ass to start dating him. Well, I guess it was the sense of hope, the ???Team Kevin???shirt my roommates made to show support of our relationship, and the drunken serenade of Elvis Presley's ???Falling In Love With You???by my friend's a capella group. From then on out, we fell fast and hard. Ours was a deep and selfless love. There was a day that he was in an especially great amount of pain, so I scratched his back while he rocked back and forth trying to make it disappear. After a few minutes, he looked at me, pulled me close, and began running his fingernails along my back even while the pain still had a grasp on him. The thing that helped him most was giving back to the people he loved. So, not surprisingly, he felt guilty about ???making me???miss my vacation after the doctors had told him he had a few weeks to live. It took him a few days to fully accept my presence there even after I reassured him that nothing in this world was more important than spending that time with him. He finally came to terms with it, and we spent the days in a whirlwind of tears, memories, heated games of Taboo, and, most importantly, unadulterated love. We looked into each other's eyes while lip syncing ???Falling In Love With You,???and I dressed up in evening wear to illegally watch a recorded version of the Symphony of the Goddesses (symphonic Legend of Zelda music) with him: something we had been hoping to attend together for months. I'll be seeing that same symphony in less than a month from now, and you can bet your sweet ass that I'll be sneaking a portion of his ashes in with me.   He took his last breath at 8:49pm on August 18th, 2015, and I can safely say that the moment after he was definitely gone was the worst moment of my life so far. I could feel something being torn from my very being as I walked outside to release the most unearthly scream I'd never hoped to hear. But the pain isn't what I want to focus on with this post. Instead, I want to reflect on everything he taught me under that sense of undying love. Cancer can never take that. Thanks for taking the time to read our story; it's important to me that it's out there in the world.

She mostly did Cognitive Based Therapy for my PTSD and it did wonders, but we have come to a wall in my recovery, and opened up the door for medicine. I just got prescribed Lexapro today and took my first dose, I know the effects won't kick in for about 4 weeks, but I am just curious if anyone else tried Lexapro or what they know about it in general. Also a little pep-talk about getting started on meds to begin with, because I don't know if this is true for anyone else, but I am terrified of how it is going to change me, I know it is supposed to be change for the better, but what if it changes a part of myself that I love?","I was on Epilum, did wonders for my head not much for the body. Gave me some perspective and space between thoughts unsure if that makes sense. I wasn't as anxious, I could pick up a thought and look at it rationally.

On Epilum I gained weight easily and had problems with balance and dizziness when I bent over a lot such as gardening and sweating heaps as well. I didn't  help things in the weight front when I had to give up working an active job to lying around hating myself. The job I worked was stressful and played havoc with my PTSD. Quitting had nothing to do with my meds. Seraqeal XR is awesome, helps me get to sleep and stay asleep.

At the moment I can manage to go to around two lectures a week, walk to the supermarket four times and maybe have one trip out with friends, as long as I have a few days notice.Still, all of those things are only possible if I am careful what I eat, or if I don't eat at all for up to two days before, and take immodium to control my nervous stomach.

Otherwise everyone thinks they can understand it, and that's where you get the result of people telling you just to ""suck it up"" or ""just think positive thoughts.""Debbie Downer? I don't know how to even to respond to that. It's so lame.

One year ago, with all of my friends leaving school, her being a freshman, and me having a few credits to go before graduation, I felt a strong urge to leave my small college town and try to make it while finishing my last few credits online. She was so sweet and loving and beautiful, everything i ever wanted. Sex was not good, but I now attribute that to the stronghold pornography has had on my life. She was a fucking blank slate, i was her first kiss, her first everything, she had her first beer with me, made love for the first time with me. We LOVED, so much.  She told me she would have married me. But she clung to me, she didnt have any real friends and used me as a coping mechanism.

He then started telling me that he can hear a 'hum' in his head and that hum is 'pure being' to him. He didn't express it with a certainty that was incredibly worrying, but it was out of character and not intellectually rigorous - which is unlike him.I'm probably overreacting but I'm concerned because he has a history of mental illness in the family, his father, as I remember, had psychotic episodes and his death was a result of it.

t3_44jg0c,t1_czsyibh,"Hey everyone, I need help clarifying a few things.So, I'm 16 and have been diagnosed with a lot of things over the past few years and the thing that has always bothered me consistently is what was diagnosed as OCD. It's an obsession with touch essentially. I can sit there locking and unlocking (or just fiddling) with the lock on a door for half an hour at a time... I try to walk away because I know it's ridiculous but it's like I can ""feel"" it in my brain, and I always end up turning around conflicted and doing it again until my brain is satisfied.Now, the hard bit with finding a resolution is I couldn't justify why I do it. (It isn't just locks, I do it with sliding doors, putting down scissors on a table, you name it) But I'm being forced to take action because it's spreading it's roots into every task I do... And that's not only frustrating, but makes the task 3x longer than it should be.I didn't always have this condition though... it developed after I sank into a depression around 12-13 and stuck with me since... but most posts seem to be claiming it's been there since birth, so I'm not sure what to do.Any advice or explanation would really be appreciated.","Sorry for your problems, man. I have both OCD and SPD myself (among others)I know how you feel. I've been dealing with this for a long time, and am STILL learning how to cope and come to grips with it, learning about myself along the way.And I'm 39.Lifelong battle for me. I have bad days, and good ones. I have bad months, and good ones. And sometime longerI know what it's like to not be able to walk away. It's hard. Those who have not been there can't understand. Empathize, logically rationalize, maybe. Understand how it feels? No.I get how sometimes it just doesn't feel....right. You have to touch it again. Adjust it again. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's still not right. What's not right? We don't know. It just isn't.There is no justification. There is no explanation. It just is.And it can be hard. And as you say, it can, and will if left unchecked, spread into everything you do.Yes, it has likely been since birth, but either was low-level until depression brought it out, or never reared it's head until the depression. Either way, it's here now. Don't focus on the how or why, just what is.What you are experiencing is NOT uncommon. You are not alone. Many, many people have this on different levels. You are not a freak. There is nothing to be scared of.It CAN be managed. You just have to figure otu how. Caunting to 10 while not touching may help the feeling go away, walking away, occupying yourself with something else, etc....Try a log of when it happens, and what you felt. Also try to record what you did to avid it or get out of the situation, if you were able to.It can be done, man.We're here. We'll help.You can do it.We believe in you.Good luck.","Empathize, logically rationalize, maybe.",2,2,2
t3_4ed7zn,t1_d1zaida,"So, I went to my first concert today. The 1975 in Vienna, my absolute favorite band. No seats, nobody to go with. Found two girls who were looking for people to go with online, met up with them a lil earlier and despite being utterly terrified of all of it (nearly chickend out at first), it went great. I never thought I could enjoy myself at a concert (not to mention I was right up front the whole time) or meet up with complete strangers and attend something like that, without having a panic attack. Today I took a risk and I'm so glad I did it, 'cause it proves again that I'm doing a lot better than I used to. It's the happiest I've been in ages and I'll probably attend another concert pretty soon. Just wanted to share my lil story, out of pure joy over it. Thanks for reading!","I was pretty scared going to my first concert, but once the band started playing their music, everyone was focused on them.

t3_37noj2,t1_croah5n,"This is my first post here, so it might not be great, but here goes.I've suffered from undiagnosed depression for a long time. Close to five years, I think. And I say undiagnosed because, while I was a high school student, I didn't want to upset my parents (who don't believe in therapy) by saying there might be something wrong, so, while I felt like it was a problem, I kept my mouth shut and pretended I was fine, even though I thought about suicide every day.Now, though, I've graduated high school, and literally days later, moved forteen hours away with my dad, who never really cared much for me or my brother (which drove him into a hole of substance abuse and basically destroying his psyche beyond repair), which was fine, since he works abroad and is never home, so it would be like living by myself. When I got here, though, I realized I wasn't ready to leave my entire life behind, especially when all of my friends weren't even planning to go to college for months. My mom said to simply call her if I wanted to come back, so I did...and was told by her that she wanted me to wait a few weeks before making any rash decisions. However, between that, everybody kinda just telling me I wanted to move and not actually asking if it's what I wanted (which managed to trick me into believing them, like an idiot), and the fact that my dad is treating me almost as if I'm just an afterthought to himself...I honestly feel like I could just disappear and nobody would notice. Or, rather, they'd be happy that they didn't have to deal with me. Even my friends, who promised we would keep in touch, have already stopped picking up the phone, and it's been just over a day.I just feel alone and unhappy, and everything I do seems to make it worse.",Are you going to go to college? College is kind of a start-over for everyone. You'll end up with a whole ton of new friends. And most offer free counseling. I get my antidepressant prescription through a psychiatrist at my school.

t3_4x3l7k,t1_d6ca0ka,"For a very long time I thought I was bi-polar, last year I met with a therapist and she asked me ""What is your goal with therapy?"" and I honestly didn't have an answer; because of that realization I didn't go back. At Christmas my dad died, and my abuser was the one to break the news to me. It triggered me more than I could have ever realized. The next six months were mostly me being numb but also realizing that I had to deal with this blackness inside my chest, this emptiness and hurt, and pain and just overwhelming nothingness. The final blow was when my abuser texted me twice after I told them not to contact me again, then proceeded to call me names and be hurtful to me. That was when I finally realized I was ready to go back to the same therapist I had visited before.I've now been to 4 sessions and yesterday was the first one I really just cried the entire time. I said things out loud that I never had before, and was trying to be open to her as much as possible. I can no longer do this myself, she is a trained professional that I'm relaying on to guide me through this. Today has been the hardest day so far on this journey. I feel like an exposed nerve. I just want to lay in bed and cry, I want to be held, but at the same time I don't want anyone to touch me. Normally anger is my strongest emotion and feeling; but today I have just felt vulnerable - not an emotion/feeling I am use to or even know how to handle properly.

t3_3fl2ye,t1_ctpmd2u,"I am a bad person. Maybe that's a lie. I don't know for sure. That's the problem. I can listen to that voice or I can listen to the other one that says that that voice is a liar. But then people come out and tell me that if I did kill myself, I'd be doing the world a favour because I'm a crazy bitch. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's not. I don't know. I'm fighting myself at this point and it's difficult. I don't know if I am objectively a bad person or not. I can't figure it out. Hell, even if people were to tell me that I wasn't, I don't know if I'd even be inclined to believe them. I'm slipping and I don't want to slip further. I'm afraid of myself, afraid that I'll snap out of my good judgement and just go for it, play with all the lies and truths inside my head, unable to distiguish which is which, and I'll just say fuck it, this pain isn't worth it anymore. I've come close a few times before, but I had friends around to keep me from going off and doing something stupid. This time is different. I am alone. I will be basically alone for the next month, except for sources of anxiety and agression towards me. I just need to stay here and talk to people for a bit so I don't lose it.","You're not a bad person.You can alienate every person you talk to, make them treat you like garbage, and push your loved ones to the brink of sanity, and then you'll only be someone like me. However, when you return and the dust settles, you'll find out there are still people standing there. The fact that you're internally conflicted should tell you that you're still a person who wants to find love, or friendship, or just a sense of belonging. Whichever it is, that alone is not something an inherently wicked person looks for. Keep listening to that voice in your head that says ""You're not a liar. You're in control. You can make good decisions. You are a good person.""You may not feel like it's the case. You may not even believe it the hundredth time you tell yourself, or the thousandth. The important part is that you still keep trying to live those words, and as long as you can try, you can be.I still tell myself these words. I have to say ""You're not a villain. You're not a habitual liar. You're trying to do the right thing. You're trying to make amends.""

t3_3j11ch,t1_culdq1m,"tl;dr: it's almost a given/guarantee i have inattentive type adhd, will be going in for official psychological testing soon. i'm having mixed feelings about it and want some guidance.I've been in therapy since the beginning of the summer for anxiety related issues. I did relate some symptoms to my therapist, that made him say the possibility of an anxiety/hypersensitivity disorder and even ADHD. The latter shocked me, and my mother, as I've always been in advanced placement, never misbehaved ever, never talked ever, etc. I had a rough school year academically, came out with some C's and D's. I've been forgetting to do things, take my iron meds, and these symptoms are all in all becoming uncontrollable. My therapist (who's very anti-med, anti-testing, etc.) blames the symptoms on my accelerated mental development and hitting milestones early from childhood on, and thinks that causes me to only be able to be at two modes- 0 and 100.I'm in denial myself. I've taken every test all over the internet, researched female ADHD, teenage ADHD, all of that, and I'm having a hard time accepting this.Someone out there willing to offer me some advice for coming at peace with myself and my ADHD? Any other girls (or guys) experienced this same thing?","I sought cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety related to performance. Found out once the anxiety was under control 9 months later that I had ADHD. Essentially, my anxiety was keeping me on track and developed as a result of ADHD. I was a polite, respectful, conscientious, and generally very good student (As &amp; Bs). I graduated cum laude in college with two degrees in 4 years. Things became really tough in graduate school when I had to manage my thesis work independently. I'm behind and I couldn't get my act together with my own research but was okay when working on group things with hard deadlines. I'm smart and could generally get away with doing everything the night before but that wasn't possible with long term projects in graduate school.I'm working on improving my work environment to support good work and focus, trying to improve my diet and exercise more, maintain better sleep habits, etc. I just started medication (day 5!) but so far it hasn't helped with focusing on work but I think I need to work harder to apply myself. It has given me much more energy. I am usually very lethargic so this is great. For me, diagnosis was a relief. I came to better understand myself and my actions. I know that I struggle with some things in ways that many others don't but I recognize everyone has their challenges. It's not part of my identity but it explains why I do some silly things. I desperately wish I had been diagnosed earlier so I wouldn't be in the difficult position I am in now. I'm not happy with myself currently but I'm working to better myself every day. I'm determined to graduate with my doctorate because I know I am capable. Having this diagnosis does not change who you are. You are still you. ADHD just puts a label on some of the things you are dealing with. You are not broken. You're just a little different. r/twoxadhd might be a good place to go as well.","I was a polite, respectful, conscientious, and generally very good student (As &amp; Bs).",2,2,2
