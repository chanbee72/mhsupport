"Got the results in today that I am JC Virus positive, so my doctor seems to think Tysabri is out of the question - risks outweigh the rewards.  What treatments are you guys on and what has worked best for you, in terms of relapses and side effects?","Being JCV+ doesn't instantly rule out Tysabri. They can do a titer and measure how positive you are (how much virus is in your system) and assess the risk better. I became JCV+ about two years ago, but my level is so low it's hardly more risk than being negative.",2,2,"Being JCV+ doesn't instantly rule out Tysabri.

Hi all. I was diagnosed in May of this year. I had Optic Neuritis 5 years ago and this relapse included total numbness from the waist down and some pain in my back. The symptoms have mostly subsided at this point. The heat makes my feet and legs tingle a bit and I get some fatigue but that's it. I have been on Tecfidera for about a month now.Recently over the past two weeks or so I have had a little bit of dizziness that happens very ocassionally. The first time I was pretty dizzy at work and had to come home to lay down. I've maybe only had 2-3 short moments since then where I noticed I am dizzy for just the briefest of moments when it's hot.It doesn't really seem like a relapse because it's not sustained and I suppose it could be related to something not even MS. My question is - at what point do you call your neuro about a new symptom? I'll be seeing mine in October and I was going to mention it then. It doesn't really seem serious enough to make a sooner appointment but maybe I'm wrong? What do you do when you see new symptoms?Thanks all! I hope Monday is treating you nicely.,"I think rule of thumb should be- don't trust your emotions too much, because as we all know the brain is sick... I got ringing in my left ear two days ago, but I didn't panic and watched what happens next, then hearing got worse, that's when I thought- ok I'm not the ear doc, I am not an MRI, let's go see a pro. Only way to know is to use science, that means see your doc and do a test if he thinks it's needed.But, don't stress for every little thing, don't stress at all if possible, I use mindfulness meditation for that, it worked wonders so far. Let's me think clearly and experience clearly, I didn't want to bother my doc too, but then I realised I am just giving into fear and I should just go for science. So, after the tests I just got back from, it's obvious everything is ok with my ear, but the ringing and hearing loss is there, so...By the way I am getting to see an MS specialist only on the 9th, they only think I might have it, not 100% yet. But this is like another sign out of other 5 that I do, still no panic. It is ok. I fear for the days when my hormones fuck up and I start depressing uncontrollably, but for now I enjoy everyday, and do the smart things- exercise, diet and don't panic ever. If I have it I will adjust accordingly and start medication and so on, but I am getting ready just incase. I love a ducking challegenge, so it helps ;]Other guys with more experience should feel free to bash my response, as I am not even diagnosed yet.Anyway, I love you all like I said last time &lt;3",1,1," But, don't stress for every little thing, don't stress at all if possible, I use mindfulness meditation for that, it worked wonders so far.

"My fingertips are hard/pale and they're both numb and painful at the same time. It feels like my fingers are wrapped in hard smooth rubber. I pick at the scar tissue because it feels better to have raw normal feeling skin (underneath) but it's a vicious cycle because the scar tissue grows back. Whenever I try to stop the scar tissue gets brittle and splits open anyway. Sometimes I don't know if picking it off is good or bad.

"I was diagnosed with BPD, OCD and severe anxiety almost 6 years ago. After multiple stints in hospitals, two suicide attempts and A LOT of therapy, I would consider myself pretty ""well"". I graduated university, 14 months into a career, and getting married in 5 months. I do find myself relapsing during periods of stress, which I think is understandable.I have been quite stressed with my work (quite a negative work environment, and experiencing some bullying), the wedding, finances and generally suffering from a low self esteem as a result. When I was really sick I would thrive off attention - specifically people thinking I am beautiful / attractive. I was never promiscuous, but enjoyed men wanting me (specifically in the romantic sense, not just physically). It made me feel powerful - I was wanted, but they could never *have* me. I would also 'crush' quite quickly on men, but never act on it physically, more emotionally. I never did this whilst being with my fiance, and worked really hard to let that aspect of my condition go. I had to go away for a week for work. It was a week of partying and schmoozing. I found myself falling into that habit again, particularly because people were drunk and very honest with their opinions with me (this also helped me a lot with my career). There was one guy in particular, we work in the same building. I think due to low self esteem, and alcohol that I indulged in my bad habit. Now that I am back home, I am feeling really low and guilty. I find myself craving that attention and being wanted again.I am afraid that I am self sabotaging, that I am going to ruin myself, but more importantly my relationship. My fiance is incredible, and doesn't deserve a woman who does this. I am afraid of myself.","The fact that you realize you're going in to old habits is a good thing.

not sleeping between the flashbacks and nightmares. I got so worked up on Saturday that I called 111 I called my CPNs office Monday and left a message for her to call me (the receptionist told me she would be available after 4pm) She didn't call. (massive feelings of rejection) told myself she must have got held up and she would call in the morning. She didn'tcalled again today but just got the answering machine. I left a message with my name and number and who I wanted to speak to. Ive had no response.Now not only am I struggling with the flashbacks and self destructive thoughts I'm also full of feelings of rejection and like nobody gives a fuck.

"I have had a good, well paying job for almost 2.5 years where I don't have to do much work at all, but I absolutely hate it. I dread going in day in, day out, and I am thinking about quitting. I got this job via family connections and I am now estranged from my family; part of the reason I want to leave this job is to fully sever ties from my family.

"My cousin like me has bpd, also on the whole cluster b spectrum. Drug abuse history, lives at home with his parents, hangs around the wrong people.He dates women who are mentally ill themselves and has been dating a women with bipolar, last week he cut himself.He has had psychotherapy and like me it made him worse(blaming others and his upbringing for his behaviour). He needs dbt but he doesn't know he has a personality disorder.I speak to his brother not him and we are trying to get him to my psychiatrist but he seems stubborn.","Well he's stubborn because you are basically calling him mentally ill. I know I have BPD, but when someone says ""You're ill, you need help, you need to see a therapist"" it's just not fair. No one has the right to say to you that you're mentally ill, or problemed, because everyone has some sort of problem. But it's not always our fault. Because I'm labelled as Borderline, people will always assume it's my fault, that I did something, because I'm the sick one. It's not true at all.

"I don't know if this is a rant, a pity-party, a cry for help, or a real attempt at trying to get myself out of this. The past 1 or 2 months have been nothing short of a nightmare. One of the many mistakes I made was allowing men to use me. I didn't just allow them - I encouraged them. I encouraged them to use me, to use my body, to destroy my soul. Now I sit here in tears, in the throes of utter loneliness, feeling more lost than I've felt in years. It feels like there's something inherently wrong with who I am. I can pretend and function perfectly fine in normal situations, but when I'm with men, the pain comes back. My sense of worth is at an all time low. I don't think my depression has ever been this bad either. The BPD tells me that I deserve to die. The depression tells me that since I don't care about life anymore, it's really time to go home. I don't have the strength to overcome the two. Yet I sit here vacillating between wanting to heal and killing myself. I know healing is possible, but I don't think I care anymore. As for killing myself, it's so simple: it's all planned out perfectly. One step. One step and maybe pain for a few mins/hours/days, and then, oblivion. Oblivion. It's so simple. Does the pain ever go away? Will we ever feel good enough? When will I stop feeling like I'm so wrong as a human being? How does one explain to all the well intentioned mongrels that this is not just self-absorption? The pain is eating me alive.I don't think there's a point to why I've written this. Maybe I just needed a way to get the pain out","I am living for my sister and my parents. I don't really value my life, but they hold me in high regard. They've told me they would be ""devastated"" if I ever killed myself. To tell you the truth, this sort of makes me feel angry (kind of like when they tell me they feel like they are ""walking on eggshells""), but I think my anger is probably just my distorted thinking. I try to re-frame it in terms of love and affection. Plus, I know at an intellectual (from reading I have done) that suicide is really, really hard on those who are left behind.The other thing that keeps me going is that I (as I alluded to in my post above) feel that there is a slight flicker of hope. It isn't always that bright, but it is there. Right now, I'm doing all I can to help tinder that flame of hope.  I've committed myself to learning as much as I can about BPD and do throw myself into DBT. DBT is going to pretty much be my life for the next 10-12 months.  I've just started to face so many issues that I've been blind to, so now I'm going to attack the issues.  I see it much like running a marathon--you just follow the training plan, no matter what. If it is raining, or hot or you are tired--it doesn't matter, you suck it up and run.As for the self-pity? Well, I try as much as possible to keep that out of my posts. I realize that the self pity isn't helpful. But it most certainly is something I deal with. For a long time, I've thought of myself as something of the ""world's ultimate and most victimized special victim"". And, to be honest, on some days I still do.  But I try to recognize when I'm doing it (this is hard) and think about things differently (sometimes this is almost impossible). But ""almost impossible"" is STILL possible.

"Right now you're 20 years old. You've never been in love and don't know what it's like to truly suffer the loss of a relationship. You've never looked at someone like they truly matter to you; you've never told someone you love them. You're concentrated on the gym and trying to push through the days until you find what you want in life. You???e 20 years old and until this point you???e never really felt heartbreak.Until one day you meet someone who makes your heart race and your life happy. You no longer push through the days but begin to enjoy them. You tell all your friends about this wonderful person and you realise you've fallen in love. You come back to his place drunk, breathing in the familiar smell of the walls. Falling into bed you tell him for the first time you love him. He kisses you and life could not be better. You wake up the next morning and know this is it for you, you've found the person you want to be with. It doesn't matter that he lives 200 miles away. Those things are increasingly hard. You'll make it through a ton of stuff together, falling back to each other each time. You'll count the days until you can move closer to him. You'll be diagnosed with an illness and he promises he'll never leave you. It's going to be okay. Suddenly you begin to feel safe and you tell him all your secrets, try to let him in.You finally move closer, things have improved. You're both starting to feel the strain of your sickness but you don't know how to be any different. You push him away because you're so scared of him leaving anyway that you don't realise what it's doing.  Then the darkness comes. You try to kill yourself, he tries to cope with it.  Neither of you know what to do.He will do things for you no one else has, you'll get pets together and begin to get into the routine of life. But your illness is always there, waiting. And then you'll both slowly give up. You still love him deeply but you don't know how to be a human being. He doesn't care very much anymore and you find yourself lashing out. Then one night you fight, the last fight you're likely to have. You breakup for the 100th time but you never realise that it's done now. He no longer wants this, he??? not coming back.You'll wake up with a chest so heavy you don??? know how you can stand. Your friends ask you if you???e okay and you lean on the wall sobbing. You now truly know what heartbreak is.  All the memories flash before you as you sit there, head in your hands willing for your life to be over. You get up for university the next day, forcing yourself through the day. You will answer question of ""how are you"" with a smile. Too scared to open your mouth because you know the sound of your voice will tell a different story. You lock yourself in the bathroom as soon as class is over and sit quietly, tears streaming down your face.You look back on almost 3 years with a sorrow you've never felt before. Suddenly nothing matters to you. You have truly lost everything.Edit:My relationship ended and I needed to let this out.

"I have a minor case of BPD, or at least it is beginning to be that way. As someone who is mentally ill, I'm doing fairly well for myself: I've been completely sober for 2 years, I'm in a committed relationship with a great guy, and I'm creating a career for myself at the young age of 20. I do not self-harm by cutting or burning myself; the worst I do is verbally abuse myself and my partner, as well as idealize suicide (it is an ""option"" to me).While my symptoms may be minor compared to other people's, the times when my disorder takes over and I get angry can be quite scary. My boyfriend has feared for both my life and his own when I am dysregulating. Thankfully, these severe episodes only happen a few times a month (as opposed to daily or having it 3-4 times a week). However, not a day goes by that I do not feel mass amounts of stress about everything. Not a day goes by that I don't feel ridden with emotions. I haven't been on medication for a couple years. 2 years ago I was on a high dosage of Seroquel, prescribed for my misdiagnose of Bipolar 2 Disorder. I went off of it because it didn't really help with my depressive or irritable moods, though looking back I may have experienced less psychotic episodes. This was also when I stopped using illegal street drugs and drinking alcohol, so weening myself off of all medication seemed like the right thing to do at the time.I was diagnosed with BPD a year ago and had visited a psychologist monthly. After about a year of therapy (and learning DBT), he let me go because he thought he saw a great improvement in me and had nothing more to teach me. I did not truly feel that I was ready but trusted his judgement. And now, my boyfriend and I are both toying with the idea that I need to see a psychologist again and perhaps try using medication again for help ease some of my problems related to the disorder.Please tell me your thoughts on the matter. Thank you so much.","I hear you. I have been told that SSRIs (prozac etc.) also reduce anxiety, although I'm not convinced of that. I do believe that SSRIs would help anger quite a bit although they are primarily used for depression. The problem with meds of any stripe is that they affect everyone so differently. I took Wellbutrin at two different times in my life and had two wildly different reactions to them each time. I think trial and error is the way to go and that's too bad because it takes forever to get the right drug and you go through hell in the process. Lithium works really, really well for me as a mood stabilizer, but it literally made me sick and it also requires that you get regular blood tests.",2,2," I have a minor case of BPD, or at least it is beginning to be that way.

"Kevin and I were perfect for each other. At least, that's what everyone who really knew us said. He was a nerd. A video game playing, Modest Mouse loving, introverted guy who was on the tail end of tackling his depression and finally graduating college after five and a half years. I was a nerd. A video game playing, My Chemical Romance loving, extroverted young woman who was fully convinced she was doomed to a life without romantic love and was struggling her way through freshman weed out classes at a large university. We met in group therapy. Now, you have to understand, our relationship was full of odd coincidences and strangely spot on foreshadowing, but this was the first of those incidences. My grief counselor now is the same therapist who led the group. Funny how things turn out. The second coincidence: the fact that, one day in therapy, we focused on another member who was anxious about a genetic test. Her mom had recently discovered that she carried a gene that's indicative of breast cancer, so her daughter ???our fellow group member ???obviously had to be tested for it. Kevin would later tell me that he sat in that dimly lit room, struggling to grasp how he would deal with her situation. He was so grateful at the time that oncogenes didn't run in his family. That was before he was tested for CDH1. That was before he knew he was positive for CDH1. That was before he had stomach cancer. We spent the next few months working through a tough situation (that I won't elaborate on) together and becoming best friends, him quickly falling for me while I was too busy caught up in someone else who would eventually leave me behind for a nomadic lifestyle. A little while after the other guy left, Kevin asked me on a date, leading to a night of loudly talking about Japanese blow job game shows at a fancy restaurant and playing Silent Hill 2. I couldn't think of a more perfect date. Still, I wasn't fully convinced that I was romantically interested in him, which he took with grace and backed off to a very respectable level. Nonetheless, I could tell he never fully gave up on the idea of us. Months passed by. We went to shitty concerts, spent far too long in each other's apartments, helped one another through hangovers, and had hours-long conversations that usually ended in the conclusion: ???Life is weird.???  He was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer a month after graduating. Even though the five year survival rate for his stage of stomach cancer is 4%, he convinced me that he was going to get his stomach removed after a few rounds of chemo, and life would continue as normal. I believed him. Only later did I realize that it was just his wonderfully developed sense of hope talking. The cancer was inoperable. Still, that same sense of hope kept him going long enough for me to pull my head far enough out of my ass to start dating him. Well, I guess it was the sense of hope, the ???Team Kevin???shirt my roommates made to show support of our relationship, and the drunken serenade of Elvis Presley's ???Falling In Love With You???by my friend's a capella group. From then on out, we fell fast and hard. Ours was a deep and selfless love. There was a day that he was in an especially great amount of pain, so I scratched his back while he rocked back and forth trying to make it disappear. After a few minutes, he looked at me, pulled me close, and began running his fingernails along my back even while the pain still had a grasp on him. The thing that helped him most was giving back to the people he loved. So, not surprisingly, he felt guilty about ???making me???miss my vacation after the doctors had told him he had a few weeks to live. It took him a few days to fully accept my presence there even after I reassured him that nothing in this world was more important than spending that time with him. He finally came to terms with it, and we spent the days in a whirlwind of tears, memories, heated games of Taboo, and, most importantly, unadulterated love. We looked into each other's eyes while lip syncing ???Falling In Love With You,???and I dressed up in evening wear to illegally watch a recorded version of the Symphony of the Goddesses (symphonic Legend of Zelda music) with him: something we had been hoping to attend together for months. I'll be seeing that same symphony in less than a month from now, and you can bet your sweet ass that I'll be sneaking a portion of his ashes in with me.   He took his last breath at 8:49pm on August 18th, 2015, and I can safely say that the moment after he was definitely gone was the worst moment of my life so far. I could feel something being torn from my very being as I walked outside to release the most unearthly scream I'd never hoped to hear. But the pain isn't what I want to focus on with this post. Instead, I want to reflect on everything he taught me under that sense of undying love. Cancer can never take that. Thanks for taking the time to read our story; it's important to me that it's out there in the world.

My doctor explained it one time and gave me some long spiel about salivary glands and taste buds that I didn't really understand tried those things and they worked.",1,1,"So, my Pa has liver cancer, and the doctors won't give him chemo until he gets his weight up.

"Greetings!I'm a 23 yeard old male, I was diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid cancer back in June and had a total total thyroidectomy on june 23rd, the cancer was determined to be at stage 1 after taken out, it now been bout 5 week ish without my thyroid and I'm currently scheduled to an see an endocrinologist this week.I felt great for first few weeks after surgery, but lately fatigue has taken over me and I sleep for almost 10 hours everyday, also my muscle and bones start to feel really ache and tiring like I'm an old man.I read up the side effect of being deprived of thyroid hormones and kind of panicked so I'm trying to get to the hormones replacement treatment as soon as I could.I would like to know anyone here had thyroid surgery, how long did you have to wait to get your hormones replacement, I heard some people waited couple months but would't that be extremely dangerous? Also I was told by the surgeon I might need to be placed under Radioactive iodine treatment BEFORE I can get to start on the thyroid hormones replacement, which mean even longer wait until I have any meds. Is this normal?I was not prescribed anything but pain med after discharged and was told to take few tums a day for a week, but I stopped, is it still necessary to take them a month after?Thank you so much for your time!","Hello friend. You have what I have (although I'm stage 2, and kind of drunk at the moment - this is part of being post-cancer normal, you get on the internet and tell people what cancer is like after you've been out for the night). It's normal to wait to get the RAI (or Iodine 131 treatment) before you get your meds. This is effectively thyroid starvation; they make your thyroid tissue desperate for iodine, and then feed it what is effectively poisoned iodine to kill it. Which sounds, well, awful. But it's what works. Radioiodine treatment will start when the doctors feel is right. So take a deep breath - you're on track. You can go a while before they start giving you replacement hormones. You'll be tired, but it won't do any real harm to wait a bit.",2,2," Which sounds, well, awful. But it's what works.",comment
"I just found out that a friend is staying at the hospital for an extended, indefinite period of time to care for her relative who has cancer.  I want to put together a care package for her and I need some ideas.  I thought of lots of quarters for the vending machines, small snacks, maybe some hand lotion and lip balm, a book (any recommendations for light, happy reading?). What else do you think I should include?","An iPad? Lots of free books out there for it, including ones that run on Kindles (for which there's a Kindle app in the Apple Store). And games. And the radio, too. ...and it's really nifty for taking notes - medications needed, meds taken, questions to ask the doctors and nurses....(Light happy reading? Gerald Durrell. He was a British naturalist who had a rather ...odd... upbringing. The three books of his I always recommend are ""My Family and Other Other Animals"", ""Birds, Beasts, and Relatives"", and ""The Picnic and Other Inimitable Stories"" (the last of which was sold under the title of ""The Picnic and Suchlike Pandemonium"" in Britain). He wrote others, but you, errr, she should start with those three, in order.One should note my sister tried using them as bedtime stories for all three of her children. Never finished any of them; she kept breaking up in laughter.",2,2," An iPad?

"May 16th marks my mother's one year of passing due to cancer. I just... the pain will never go away. I still miss her so much. I thought of her a lot, and I still do.Right now, I am very much upset and so angry at myself.I have so much regret. Not talking to her more. Not appreciating all the things she did for us. I think about the candy covered apple and the chocolate covered strawberries she asked me to get for mothers day one time. I never got it for her. I think about that and I get so fucking angry with my self. She spent everyday of her life working to make sure we had what we need, and worked even harder to give what we wanted. I wish I was able to give back to her. I want her here so I can be able to take her on trips, or buy her those designer bags she wanted but couldnt afford. I want to be able to get her those candy covered apples and those chocolate covered strawberries. I hate myself sometimes for not being a better daughter to her. I also hate you the most cancer. Fuck you so much.Sorry, i needed to let things out...","Make some candy apples and chocolate covered strawberries in her honor. Remember her, talk to her, and try to forgive yourself. Edit: And yes - fuck cancer very much.",1,1,"Make some candy apples and chocolate covered strawberries in her honor. Remember her, talk to her, and try to forgive yourself.
